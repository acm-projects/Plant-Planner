<p align="center"> Have too many plants and a busy schedule, or is that just me? Plant owners know the struggle of balancing a buzzing lifestyle and still taking care of the plants they love, especially when they all have such different needs! Plant Planner takes away the stress by automatically creating watering and fertilizing schedules based off of a plantâ€™s need. Simply type in the name of your plant and Plant Planner will automatically add its watering schedule to your Google Calendar. </p>

<h2>MVP ðŸŒ¿</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User Account with Login Authentication</li>
  <li>Page which displays all your plants and their general information</li>
 <ul>
  <li>such as image, plant, nickname, water preferences, light preferences, etc (Discuss what should be here)</li>
 </ul>
  <li>Ability to add and delete plants from your page</li>
  <li>Connects with Perenual or other API to pull information about the plants</li>
  <li>Creates a watering schedule based on information pulled from the API and implements with Google Calendar</li>
</ul>
<p>Backend will be using the Perenual API to gather information about an uploaded plant. Backend will also be maintaining a mySQL database and create an API to query information from it.</p>
<p>Frontend be using Figma to prototype the application. Frontend will be using Android Studio to create the application pages and display information to the user.</p>



<h2>Stretch Goals ðŸŒ¿</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add fertilization Schedule</li>
  <li>In case the user doesn't know the plant name, have a quiz that will allow the app to guess its watering preferences</li>
 <ul>
  <li> example: hard, stiff, and bulbous leaves -> is a succulent -> requires water once every two weeks and direct sunlight</li>
 </ul>
  <li>Add 'growth tracker' which would notify the user to take a picture every month in order to track the plants growth</li>
  <li>Sunlight sensor which would sense how bright an area is (bright direct/bright indirect/medium/dark)</li>
  <li>Add social aspect</li>
  <li>Adjust based on local weather conditions</li>
</ul>
